Scramble 1:
R' U' F D' B D L' U B' U D' R B2 L2 U L2 D' F2 D R2 B2 F' R' U' F

B (D' F) // EO
L (U' D L2 U' B2 D L') // DR
(R2 U' D') // HTR/3e3e3e

Skeleton: B @ L D U ^ R2 L D' B2 U L2 D' U F' D

@: B2 L R' U2 R L' [6-3]
^: U' D B2 U D' % R2 [6-5]
%: U2 R' L F2 R L' [6-3]

Solution: B' L R' U2 R D2 B2 U' D' R' L F2 R D' B2 U L2 D' U F' D [21]

Comments: Not much to say here besides everything was just lucky. Very lucky HTR. Very nice insertions. 
Starting with a 21 did put a bit of pressure for the rest of the mean, which manifests itself in solve 2...


Scramble 2:
R' U' F D' F2 U' L2 U' B2 F2 L2 B R' D B F' L D L' R U2 R' U' F

R (B U2 L) // EO
(R2 D B' R2 D' F D) // DR
L2 ^  U2 L2 F' // 2c+edges
(D F' U F2 D' F D F2 U' D' F) // j-perm bruhhh

^: L2 F2 R2 F2 L2 B2

Solution: R F2 R2 F2 L2 B2 U2 L2 F2 D U F2 D' F' D F2 U' F D2 F' D R2 B D' R2 L' U2 B' [28]

Comments: yeah this was brutal. solve 1 being nice put the pressure on here. 
I definitely wasn't in the right mindspace for this attempt because I was thinking of so many other things. 
Lots of EOs explored, but not too many great RZPs. Some short DRs such as R (B U2 L R2 D B' U' B U), which is DR in 10, 
but as with basically all other DRs I found, the corners were ugly for me. 
I'm surprised this solution was even sub-30 because of how poor it actually is. Was very sad with myself after this solve.


Scramble 3:
R' U' F L' U' L2 U F2 D' U2 L2 R2 B' D2 L B U2 L' R' U F2 R' U' F

(L F' R D) // EO
R' F B2 ^ L' R2 B // DR
R' U2 @ F2 L U2 D2 // 3E3C

^: F' R' B2 R F R' B2 R [8-3]
@: U' D R2 U D' F2 [6-3]

Solution: R' B2 R' B2 R F R' B2 L' R' B R' U D R2 U D' L U2 D R' F L' [23]

Comments: Struggled to find something nice for this solution, so got bailed out with this skeleton towards the end. 
Honestly, not the most beautiful creation of all time, but hey, it's a 23, can't complain too much. 
Was actually quite satisfied with this solve, handed it in with like 6 minutes left (normally I use the full 60 minutes) and then watched the super bowl LOL


Overall comments: 21, 28, 23 = 24.00. It's hard to be upset with PR single and mean. But it is really disappointing. 
Last PR mean of 24.67 had a counting 27, and now a 24.00 with a counting 28. 
On one hand, it shows potential for something really amazing, but given the infrequency in which I compete in FMC, 
it's just painful to live with a disappointing result for so long. 
At the same time though, I'm not really sure what I missed on the 28, so I can't be too mad at myself. 
I definitely think I still have the skills for a sub-23 mean, even though I've been so out of FMC for a long while. 
Just need to make it happen. Good things coming soon.

Comp overall was great. It was really weird to just hop on a flight from Philly to Chicago for a weekend, but I had a really good time. 
Midwest competitions are my FAVORITE, and this comp was good. Even though it was a silent comp, it was still fun to be there. 
Hope to keep coming back to midwest comps, especially in the chicago area.
