ATTEMPT 1:

(L' F' R U2 B) // EO

^ U2 L2 F2 B2 // 2E2E in 21 :(

^: B2 R2 D2 R2 D2 R2 D2 B2 (8-0)

Solution: U D' F2 U2 D' L' R2 B2 D' B2 D' B2 R2 D2 R2 D2 R2 D2 B2 U2 L2 F2 B2 U B' U2 R' F L (29)

Comments: Going into this comp, I had averaged ~4.75 hours of sleep across the prior 3 nights, and seeing as this was the first attempt of the day, I knew it wasn't going to be great. Scramble was atrocious imo and I just struggled to find thing. I could blame the fact that I was sleepy, but really it's just because I was rusty. This really set the tone for the rest of the mean because I knew a lot of opportunities for anything good were lost.

ATTEMPT 2:

(B' D' F) // EO
(L' R2 F2 D R') // DR

Solution: D' L2 D2 R2 U2 B2 U2 L2 B2 F2 D' R2 D' R2 D' R D' F2 R2 L F' D B (23)

Comments: Nice scramble with a few 3 move EOs that I spent most of my time exploring. Took WAY too long to find the 8 move DR. Even though it is a 1 move RZP, it was kinda unintuitive. Nothing else to say about this solve. pretty boring overall.

Comments: This was one of the riskiest attempts I have done. Going into this solve, I had a 2 move lead on second place (but honestly, I didn't really care too much about winning because I was upset about the start of the mean). I basically didn't look at any DRs at all because I was so intrigued by the first 8 moves of this solution. I tried to ushakov my way into a solved cube, but it just didn't work, and that took up maybe like 25 minutes of my time. I also had this blockbuilding skeleton: 

L (F R) // EO + SQ
F (B' U2 B' U' L2 B') //
(U' F U F' U) // 14 to 5c

But insertions were trash so couldn't even use that. Ended up going with the stupid solution above at the last minute because I found the edge insertion that cancelled 3. Really sketchy attempt and I'm sure there was some good stuff I missed because of not checking DRs, but that's part of the fun of FMC!


------

Mean: 29, 23, 27 = 26.33 (First place)

Overall comments: Not a great mean by any stretch of the imagination, but still happy to win. I can't expect myself to get a great mean every single time. Mediocre/bad means are bound to happen, and external situations suggested that this was the comp for a bad mean. Scrambles were slightly below average imo so I'll just blame that. 

I definitely need to work on my time management going forward and figure a more systematic way to approach FMC because I think I am wasting a lot of time during the attempt doing stupid things or checking things I have already checked, and not writing everything down. oh well! 

Good things still to come :)
